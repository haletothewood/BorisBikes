# Boris Bikes - Week 1 Challenge

The first weekly project assigned during my time at Makers Academy. [Here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/0_challenge_map.md) is the challege that was set. 

## Daily Log

During the week I had a different pair partner and had to ensure that all remotes were assigned correctly such that any collaborative pushes went to the correct repositories. Agile methodologies and TDD principles were applied throughout.
