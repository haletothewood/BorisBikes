# Boris Bikes - Week 1 Challenge

The first weekly project assigned during my time at Makers Academy. [Here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/0_challenge_map.md) is the challege that was set. 

## Daily Log

During the week I had a different pair partner and had to ensure that all remotes were assigned correctly such that any collaborative pushes went to the correct repositories. Agile methodologies and TDD principles were applied throughout.

#### Day One

Pair Partner: [Austin](https://github.com/andyrow123)

Successes: 
- Created and collaborated on single repo from two machines for the first time.
- We made our first passing test!
- We both struggle with slowing down and I think we called each other out on this in a really constructive way
- Learned how to fetch a singular file from a repository and merge with master using `git fetch` and `git checkout FETCH-HEAD`

Struggles:
- Ensuring that before moving onto another part of the challenge that I understand why something works or doesn't work
- Remembering to `git pull` before adding any changes to the remote repo

#### Day Two
